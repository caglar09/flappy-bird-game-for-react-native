## Flappy Bird Fame For ReactNative

In this project, I am trying to make **Flappy Bird** similar to react-native.

When coding this game **[react-native-game-engine](https://github.com/bberak/react-native-game-engine)** and **[matter-js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js)** libraries.


## Installation

npm: 
```
npm install
```

Yarn
```
yarn
```

Not required **pod install** for ios.
